name: Publish Development Images

# DESCRIPTION:
# This workflow automates the building and publishing of the standardized development
# container images (base images) used across the Nova Ecosystem.
#
# 1. It triggers on pushes to 'main' or manual dispatch.
# 2. It uses a matrix strategy to build 'python' and 'node' images in parallel.
# 3. It sets up 'Buildx' to enable advanced caching (type=gha).
# 4. It pushes the final images to: ghcr.io/nova-ecosystem/dev-[language]:latest

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # Allow manual trigger as well

      # This step creates a 'docker-container' builder driver.
      # This is REQUIRED for 'cache-to: type=gha' to work.
